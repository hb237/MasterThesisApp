        <h4>Start and Stop</h4>
        <p>
            In the page General settings there are a green play and a red stop discard button. Before launching a new
            monitoring instance the user must save the changes they made to the settings. If they later on decide to
            stop the application it will delete all intermediate data structures.
        </p>

        <h4>General settings</h4>
        Below you can find a description of each configuration parameter:
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Dashboard refresh rate:</strong><br>
                The rate that defines how often a AJAX query will fetch data from the server. The value is the time in
                seconds in between two requests.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Start block:</strong><br>
                The lowest block number that the application should still include into the monitoring.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>End block:</strong><br>
                The highest block number that the application should still include into the monitoring.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Monitoring window block size:</strong><br>
                The maximum number of blocks that will serve as an input for the monitoring.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Confirmation blocks</strong><br>
                Number of most recent blocks the monitoring application should not process.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Data input mode:</strong><br>
                Select whether the application should work with test data or live streaming data.

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Example data set:</strong><br>
                This setting applies if the data input mode defines to work with test data. The user can select the test
                data set they want to use.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Replay speed:</strong><br>
                This setting applies if the data input mode defines to work with test data. The user can accelerate or
                slow down the replay of the blocks in the tas data set. Numbers above 1 accelerate and below 1 slow
                down the replay.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Noise threshold:</strong><br>
                When creating BPMN diagram the noise parameter defines how many activities the algorithm includes into
                the model. The values range between 0 and 1.

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Geth node IP address:</strong><br>
                The IP of the Geth node the application should connect to.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Geth node port:</strong><br>
                The Port of the Geth node the application should connect to.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Convert ETH to currency:</strong><br>
                The currency the dashboard prices should be displayed in. It converts costs in Ether in to the current
                market price for the selected currency.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Monitoring status</strong><br>
                The monitoring status shows whether the monitoring process is currently running or if it is stopped.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>BLF manifest</h4>
        <p>The manifest editor provides the user with a simple option to edit, validate and save BLF manifest to the
            server. One can also download from the server the currently stored manifest or upload an already existing
            manifest from the local machine.</p>

        <h4>BPMN Model</h4>
        <p>
            The BPMN editor provides the user with an appealing editor to create simple BPMN diagrams and then save them
            to
            the server. It provides only a small subset of all BPMN elements, du to pm4py's limitations. One can also
            download from the server the currently stored BPMN model or upload an already existing BPMN model from the
            local
            machine.
